== Misc

* TASK: generate a website for JMAP documentation with annotations
** NOTE: we already have the commands to generate some html
** NOTE: add the publish process into jenkins (master)
** NOTE: create a container with the html files and static webserver
** NOTE: handle reverse proxy to james.open-paas.org/doc -> jmap spectification; james.open-paas.org/ci -> jenkins

* TASK: Use only mailbox-api into jmap
** NOTE: use only managers, not mappers
** NOTE: write an attachment manager
** TODO: list all conversion work needed (MessageResultIterator et al.)

* TASK: Add 3 gatling scenarios 
** TODO: ask UX team about usages

* TASK: fix bug INBOX-37 about handling cyrillic content in VacationMailet

* TASK: decode email title when it contains charset tags (INBOX-37, to be split)

* TODO: retry INBOX-289

* TASK: allow empty subject when sending mail (INBOX-291)
** TODO: ask INBOX if it's ok to put an empty subject instead of null or absent value

* TODO: retry INBOX-298 and/or read the specification

== Questions

* How hard would it be to filter on mailbox and/or users when use Filter on GetMessagesList
** Answer: very. Off course no user indexing at all. James filtering API needs a Mailbox to search on. So it is not possible to compose any filter containing requests such as (inMailboxes=... or notInMailboxes=...). If we don't need compositing or a very simple compositing (2 clauses) the problem can be solved in JMAP backend. To have a plain support we need to end or work on unifying UID, ie a message should have a single id whatever is its mailbox. The good news: elasticsearch is already basing its indexing on such an UID, so maybe extending the API could fit our need for now.
* How hard is it the handle mailbox rename for search ?
** Answer : It should work right now because mailboxId doesn't change on rename. We have to write a test anyway.

* Do we have an implementation that works without requiring filesystem and that is fast to start for InMemory tests ?
** Lucene search is not really tested but should support InMemory
** There's a scanning search implementation, it's slow but should work
** IMAP only ask for substring matching, but JMAP suggest full text search
** ES does not conform to IMAP search but is ok for JMAP
** JMAP says `The exact semantics for matching String fields is deliberately not defined to allow for flexibility in indexing implementation, subject to the following` so any impl should be ok, we only have to be careful about test involving tests
** ES helps implementing https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6237 
** We can make UidSearchOnIndex and ElasticSearchIntegrationTest to run on all search impl
