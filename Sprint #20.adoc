3 pts

* TASK: index users that have access to a message
** NOTE: update ES schema

2 pts

* TASK: add inMailboxes criteria into SearchQuery
** NOTE: implement inMailboxes filtering into 3 backends
** NOTE: must be done before Filter to SearchQuery conversion

2 pts

* TASK: multi-mailbox support in GetMessagesList
** NOTE: add an api in MessageSearchIndex to query regarless of a mailbox
** NOTE: CAPABILITY

2 pts

* TASK: map the Filter POJO tree to a SearchQuery
** NOTE: no Thread* support
** NOTE: generate a toString for the tree

3 pts

* TASK: make GetMessagesList call the search api implementations

2 pts

* TASK: implement some significant search

3 pts

* TASK: handle large subject when indexing (INBOX-381)


== Misc

* TASK: emit a New Account request (on https://id.apache.org/acreq/ ?) for RaphaÃ«l

* TASK: generate a website for JMAP documentation with annotations
** NOTE: we already have the commands to generate some html
** NOTE: add the publish process into jenkins (master)
** NOTE: create a container with the html files and static webserver
** NOTE: handle reverse proxy to james.open-paas.org/doc -> jmap spectification; james.open-paas.org/ci -> jenkins

* TASK: Use only mailbox-api into jmap
** NOTE: use only managers, not mappers
** NOTE: write an attachment manager
** TODO: list all conversion work needed (MessageResultIterator et al.)

* TASK: Add 3 gatling scenarios 
** TODO: ask UX team about usages

* TASK: fix bug INBOX-37 about handling cyrillic content in VacationMailet

* TASK: decode email title when it contains charset tags (INBOX-37, to be split)

* TODO: retry INBOX-289

* TASK: allow empty subject when sending mail (INBOX-291)
** TODO: ask INBOX if it's ok to put an empty subject instead of null or absent value
** NOTE: after rereading the spec, in saving draft: "subject: Optional. Defaults to the empty string ("")." So I think we should allow subject to be null in input (setMessages), and in this case return empty string as output (getMessages).
* TODO: retry INBOX-298 and/or read the specification

* TODO: see what must be done to implement JAMES-1785 (setMessages : moving a message)

== Questions

* TODO: check that jmap `text` search maps well on what ES do right now
** NOTE: here is the specification from the text property on FilterCondition:
"text: String|null Looks for the text in the from, to, cc, bcc, subject, textBody or htmlBody properties of the message."
** NOTE: the easiest way (without changing the ES indices) is to handle multiple fields in `IndexableMessage`.
For example, `IndexableMessage` may have a `text` attibute which will be the concatenation of `from`, `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `subject`, `textBody` and `htmlBody`
** NOTE: we may also add a `body` attribute for `textBody` and `htmlBody`
** NOTE: for information: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22617674/does-elasticsearch-have-compound-indexes#22657490

* TODO: work on tasks ordering to to deliver support for `text` as fast as possible


* How hard would it be to filter on mailbox and/or users when use Filter on GetMessagesList
** Answer: very. Off course no user indexing at all. James filtering API needs a Mailbox to search on. So it is not possible to compose any filter containing requests such as (inMailboxes=... or notInMailboxes=...). If we don't need compositing or a very simple compositing (2 clauses) the problem can be solved in JMAP backend. To have a plain support we need to end or work on unifying UID, ie a message should have a single id whatever is its mailbox. The good news: elasticsearch is already basing its indexing on such an UID, so maybe extending the API could fit our need for now.
* How hard is it the handle mailbox rename for search ?
** Answer : It should work right now because mailboxId doesn't change on rename. We have to write a test anyway.

* Do we have an implementation that works without requiring filesystem and that is fast to start for InMemory tests ?
** Lucene search is not really tested but should support InMemory
** There's a scanning search implementation, it's slow but should work
** IMAP only ask for substring matching, but JMAP suggest full text search
** ES does not conform to IMAP search but is ok for JMAP
** JMAP says `The exact semantics for matching String fields is deliberately not defined to allow for flexibility in indexing implementation, subject to the following` so any impl should be ok, we only have to be careful about test involving tests
** ES helps implementing https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6237 
** We can make UidSearchOnIndex and ElasticSearchIntegrationTest to run on all search impl
